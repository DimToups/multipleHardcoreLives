## User guide
### How is it meant to be played
The plugin is meant to be played by sessions, where players needs to be connected and all play simultaneously.

### Access to commands
In order to use the plugin, it must be at least one online operator, so it can access commands.

The most common way to access to the plugin's commands is to directly connect to you server and access to its console or to grant an operator role to a player. 
### Start and stop a session
The plugin won't properly have an effect on your server until you start a session.

If a session is not on, player deaths won't be registered. This is why I recommend every player to be online only for the duration of a session.

To start a session, an operator need to run the command ``session start``. After that, events will be registered and the plugin will fully work.

To end a session, an operator need to run the command ``session end``. A timer is set to one minute which will alert every player on the server of the imminent end of the session.
